# PiezoMate - MAGNATHON
Our idea is to utilise the mechanical energy generated in interactive environments such as gyms, playgrounds etc. The mechanical energy generated here can be convrerted into electical energy using piezoelectric materials. The energy generated can be stored in a battery and live data of the electricity can be tramsitted to the app using ioT devices. The data can be monitered using the app which will give the owners of the interactive environment useful data and insights.

## Technologies used
Figma, Piezo-electric effect

## How to configure
NA

## How to Run
First the owner of the organisation needs to register through our app and we will set up piezo-electric system and they can monitor the energy generated through a dedicated mobile app.
